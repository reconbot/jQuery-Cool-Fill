I was watching the Dues Ex Human Revolution end credts and thought the text fill they were using was cool.

Here is my version of it. It should work on any div or span that has no child elements.

TODO:
 - Make it fill in constant time.
 - Add more "cool chars"

Useage:
  $('#fillme').coolFill("text");
